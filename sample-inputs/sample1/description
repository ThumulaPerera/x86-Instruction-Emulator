add 2 vectors (x1, y1) + (x2, y2)
result (x1+x2, y1+y2)

result is available on (memory[0], memory[4])

this example (100, -200) + (10000 + 20000)

c7 c1 00 00 00 00           ecx = 0
c7 c3 00 00 00 00           ebx = 0
c7 04 8b 64 00 00 00        insert 100 as x1
41                          ecx++
c7 04 8b 38 ff ff ff        insert -200 as y1
49                          ecx--      
81 04 8b 10 27 00 00        add 10000 as x2 to x1
